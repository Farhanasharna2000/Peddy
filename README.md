### 1. **Project name**

   # Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

### 2. **Short description of the project:**
 
Peddy is a user-friendly pet adoption platform that connects prospective pet owners with rescue animals looking for a home. It simplifies the adoption process by providing detailed pet profiles, search filters, and direct communication with shelters, making it easier to find the perfect furry companion.

### 3. **Five key features of the project:**

- Users can filter pets dynamically based on different categories using buttons. When a category is selected, it triggers an API call to fetch and display pets under that specific category.


- Each pet has a "Details" button that opens a modal with detailed information such as breed, gender, date of birth, vaccination status, and more. This allows users to learn more about a specific pet before deciding to adopt.

- The platform includes an adoption button that triggers a modal congratulating users on initiating the adoption process. A countdown timer appears, and the button is disabled once the process completes, indicating that the pet is adopted.

- The application displays loading spinners while data is being fetched and shows a custom message with an image when there are no pets available for the selected category.

- Users can sort pets by price using a sorting button. Additionally, a favorite button allows users to add pets to their favorites section, where they can view all liked pets in a separate display area.
